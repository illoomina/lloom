//! The decode loop — `Session::decode`, the baseline (K=1) body of
//! `design/docs/decode-driver-design.md`, stage 1.
//!
//! The loop names two seams and neither concrete arm: a [`Speculator`] for
//! *which* proposer (stage 1 admits only [`IdentityProposer`], the K=1 identity;
//! the verify body is stage 2 and is refused rather than approximated) and a
//! [`ReadbackStrategy`] for how a step feeds the next forward and learns EOS.
//! The harness selects both and never writes the body.
//!
//! # The invariant, and what it costs to hold
//!
//! The design's hot path *does not commit, does not block, does not read
//! back*: sample on the device, feed the ring, enqueue the forward, bump
//! counters. The one thing the loop must eventually learn per token is whether
//! it was EOS, and where that wait sits decides everything:
//!
//! - **`lookahead = 0`** waits for step `s`'s publish *before* encoding forward
//!   `s`. The cache never advances past an EOS, so the arm is safe for a
//!   multi-turn conversation on any cache — and the GPU idles from the publish
//!   to the first commit of the next forward, which is the non-GPU gap
//!   (§11.2b's 0.74 ms). The publish must be committed before the host can wait
//!   on it, so this arm commits per token whatever the budget says; the
//!   `commits` counter reports it.
//! - **`lookahead = 1`** encodes forward `s` first and waits for step `s`'s
//!   publish afterwards, while that forward runs. The GPU always has the next
//!   step queued, so the gap closes — and when step `s` turns out to be EOS,
//!   forward `s` has already been enqueued: **the cache is one position past
//!   the EOS**, reported as [`DecodeStats::overrun`]. A caller that continues
//!   the conversation from that cache needs a rewind the crown configuration
//!   (`KvAppend=Cat`, `ConvState=Shuffle`) cannot express, so this arm is for a
//!   run whose cache ends with it, or for a cache that can rewind (stage 2's
//!   `advance`/`resolve` window is the mechanism).
//!
//! The ordering across steps is candle's own fence chain and is unchanged by
//! the lookahead: forward `s+1`'s first encoder waits on the ring slot's last
//! writer (publish `s+1`), which waited on the argmax, which waited on forward
//! `s`'s logits — so the GPU runs the steps serially and only the *host* has
//! stopped standing between them. What the lookahead adds is that step `s+1`
//! is committed before step `s` retires.
